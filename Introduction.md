## Setting the Tone

### Code of Conduct

[Code of Conduct](http://software-carpentry.org/conduct/)

Everyone in this room belongs here.
You have exactly the right background, training, and amount of experience that you need to participate in this workshop.

## Logistics

### Etherpad

One way we use the Etherpad is to "crowd-source" notes about the workshop.
Are you a more advanced learner in a particular lesson?
Do you have a pro tip?
Please share your knowledge with us!
You should also feel free to ask and answer questions on the Etherpad's chat function.
We'll try to get to any unanswered questions during the break; of course, you should also feel free to interrupt us with a question at any time.

### Lesson Materials

All the lessons today will be "hands on;" we encourage you type the exercises up as we do.
Some participants at past workshops have commented that this prevents them from simultaneously taking notes.
Don't worry!
We'll have the lesson materials posted online and linked from the Etherpad by the end of the workshop.
These linked resources will feature the same exercises we're doing in class so you can use them as a future reference.
