## Logistics

### Etherpad

One way we use the Etherpad is to "crowd-source" notes about the workshop.
Are you a more advanced learner in a particular lesson?
Do you have a pro tip?
Please share your knowledge with us!
You should also feel free to ask and answer questions on the Etherpad's chat function.
We'll try to get to any unanswered questions during the break; of course, you should also feel free to interrupt us with a question at any time.
