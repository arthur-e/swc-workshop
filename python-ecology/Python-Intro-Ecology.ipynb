    "This lesson introduces Python as an environment for data analysis and visualization. The materials are based on the Data Carpentry [Python for Ecologists lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/). However, the lesson focuses on general analysis and visualization of tabular data and is not specific to ecologists or ecological data. As Data Carpentry explains:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Data Carpentryâ€™s aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read and write basic Python code;\n",
    "- Import and export tabular data with Python;\n",
    "- Subset and filter tabular data;\n",
    "- Understand different data types and data formats;\n",
    "- Understand pandas Data Frames and how they help organize tabular data;\n",
    "- Devise and intepret data processing workflows;\n",
    "- Automate your data cleaning and analysis with Python;\n",
    "- Visualize your data using matplotlib and pandas;\n",
    "- Connect to a SQLite database using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will not prepare you to use Python as a general purpose programming language; there are some parts of the language we won't have time to cover. However, at the end of this lesson, you will have a good grasp of Python syntax and be well-prepared to learn the rest of the language, if you desire to do so. **Even without seeing all of the Python programming language, you will be prepared to analyze and visualize data in Python using pandas and matplotlib.**"
